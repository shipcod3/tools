# metasploit-modules
This repository contains ROOTCON Labs' random metasploit modules wherein some modules have already been merged with the Metasploit Framework: ```https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=Jay+Turla```. Some stack buffer overflow exploit modules may be unreliable due to offsets and that all of the remote code execution exploits are most likely reliable.

If you happen to see False Positives for the auxiliary modules please file an issue or create a pull request to remediate the False Positives.

# Notes
- Use msftidy before pushing your code
- Do stick to the Ruby style guide
- Do get Rubocop relatively quiet against the code you are adding or modifying
- Issue a pull request and do not automatically merge your code to check your modules
- Don't use hard tabs (2 spaces please)
